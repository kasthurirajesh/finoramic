Here all dependencies are included in data.json. 

Intially data is read from the file and it  is key and value format i.e.(key = packageName, value = version number)

once you have the package name with version number we can install the package with the help of pip.

Here each time stdout is stored in stdout.txt 

from the stdout we can now search for specified keywords in the stdout.file 

if the keywords are (Successfully installed)  or (Requirement already satisfied) , it means it is successfully installed else it is not installed

if the package is not installed then I create a file with the packageName.txt.
